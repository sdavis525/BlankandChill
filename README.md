> In my latest project I built a front-end Netflix clone with a Firebase back-end. I used the TMDB API for all of the data and Firebase Authentication to give login functionality. You are able to store user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. I used Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - and this app is LIVE with Firebase hosting.
